# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Dataset
Application of Resnet34 with or without transfer learning in a 4 class disease dataset
In this project, a multiclass classification problem is targeted to be solved using end to end deep learning approach. Image classification and segmentation have been a huge application field for deep learning for quite some time now. On the other hand, rice is the primary food for many countries in Asia continent. Fast classification of rice diseases is therefore very much significant in terms of ensuring proper production of food in many continents of the world. For this project, four diseases have been narrowed down to predict using a publicly available. Although research has been conducted to solve the problem by incorporating both machine learning and deep learning, the main objective of this project is to apply an end-to-end deep learning network to achieve a compatible performance.
